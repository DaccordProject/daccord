.SYNOPSIS
  Authenticode-signs Windows release binaries (the app .exe, its DLLs and the
  Inno Setup installer), using either a PFX/PKCS#12 file or a certificate
  already present in the Windows store (hardware token / cloud virtual card).

.DESCRIPTION
  Called by .github/workflows/release.yml. Everything is driven by env vars so
  no secret ever appears on a command line (and therefore never in a log).

  Two credential modes, checked in this order:

    WINDOWS_CERT_SHA1         thumbprint of a certificate in
                              Cert:\CurrentUser\My — signs via the store, so
                              the private key never has to be exportable. This
                              is the mode used with Certum's cloud key after
                              dist/simplysign-login.ps1 has mounted it (that
                              script sets this variable), and it equally covers
                              a USB token on a self-hosted runner.

    WINDOWS_CERT_PFX_BASE64   base64 of a code-signing .pfx, with
    WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD     its password (optional). Public CAs stopped
                              issuing exportable keys in June 2023, so in
                              practice this is for self-signed rehearsal certs
                              and pre-2023 certificates.

    WINDOWS_TIMESTAMP_URL     RFC-3161 timestamp server            (optional,
                              defaults to http://timestamp.digicert.com;
                              Certum certificates want http://time.certum.pl)

  **Never fails the release.** With neither credential set the script prints a
  warning and exits 0, leaving the artifacts unsigned exactly as they were
  before signing existed. The workflow additionally marks the signing steps
  `continue-on-error: true`, so even a hard signing failure (expired cert,
  timestamp server down) degrades to an unsigned-but-published release rather
  than a broken tag.

  Timestamping is not optional: without it every signature stops validating the
  day the certificate expires. The timestamp server is the flakiest part of the
  process, so it is retried a few times before giving up.

.PARAMETER Path
  One or more files to sign. Wildcards are allowed
  (e.g. `build\windows\x64\runner\Release\*.dll`). Files that already carry a
  valid signature (bundled, vendor-signed DLLs) are left alone.

.EXAMPLE
  ./dist/sign-windows.ps1 build/windows/x64/runner/Release/daccord.exe
